<p>Some basic information about me, </p>
<p>I’m Australian, always lived in Melbourne or country Victoria, only speak English, though I have tried learning Russian, now it’s probably best that I didn’t. I’m the youngest of three, and will be turning 50 this year. I have three adult kids, but I am now divorced and live by myself which I prefer as you’ll see by my Myer-Briggs test.</p>
<p>I’ve previously studied a certificate 3 in IT in the 90’s, an advanced diploma in IT in the 00’s with a number of certifications attached.  Recently I was certified in Prince 2 Foundation and Prince 2 Practitioner as I was looking to get into Project Management but due to the time length that I’ve been out of IT, I’ve decided to get a degree to further my employment opportunities. </p>
<p>I like to play single player strategy games.</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>When I was around about ten years old in the early 80’s my brother had a Dick Smith System 80 that was tape loaded.  When he wasn’t home I’d move the computer to my room so I could play games, they were very basic back then but enjoyable.  After awhile I started to learn to modify the code and even create my games, no books or internet then just looking at the code.  I guess my main interest is in programming.  I have worked in IT in the 00’s as a software/hardware technician.</p>
<p>I had two different universities offer me a Bachelors Degree in IT.  The other university wanted me to start with two subjects from a business degree that were also included in the IT degree.  RMIT went straight to IT subjects which is what I want to do.  I didn’t actually research which was the better university in regards to IT degrees, but so far I am enjoying the RMIT subjects.</p>
<p>What I’m expecting to learn in my studies at RMIT is plenty of programming and software skills. I’m still not sure what electives I will take as I’ll see how I go with each subject I do before it is time to select a elective and play to my strengths.  One thing I’m hoping to not study is padding subjects like business studies.</p>
